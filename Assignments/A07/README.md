## Assignment 07
### Weather Webscraper and GUI
#### Description: 
This program uses beautiful soup to scrap data from wunderground.com weather website
The user will first run the 'get_weather.py' file, this will call the 'gui.py' and create a form
window where the user will enter the weather parameters they wish to retrieve. Once they have entered the
location, the gui will return a url that will be used to get that weather data for the given parameters. 
A function buildweather_gui will then run and generate a table populated with the requested weather data.
