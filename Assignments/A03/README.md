### Description: Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text, commonly used for data analysis, scientific research, and machine learning.
#### I picked Jupyter Notebook because it incorporates graphing, scripting, documentation, machine learning, and virtual machines. It is mostly associated with its use with Python, but is also capable of being used with over 40 languages via virtual environments on the users local machine. Notebook is able to be used for education with it's step by step code interpretation, which also makes it an almost viable IDE option when it comes to debugging your code.
